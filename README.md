# TivaC-GPIO-LED-Control-Demos
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level embedded C projects developed for the **Tiva C Series TM4C123GH6PM** microcontroller. These projects demonstrate the use of **GPIO pins** to control LEDs and read switches, providing a practical introduction to working with hardware interfaces on ARM Cortex-M4.
